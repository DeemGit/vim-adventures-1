### Readme
[Vim Adventures](http://vim-adventures.com/) is an excellent educational game by Doron Linder.  It focuses on teaching many popular commands and motions used in the [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) text editor.  I strongly suggest you attempt all levels on your own before turning to the following spoilers.

### Levels
#### Level 8
- last puzzle →  # E # n n ^ k $ * j

#### Level 9
- puzzle to the right 
   - start on 'N' →  $ j j j  → end on 'd', get key
   - to go back, start on 'd' →  gg
